# Employee-Information-App
This application allows employers to add information about their employees to a website that displays basic information about their employees for easy access.

## Usage
Use this app to create a team page where your employees are listed. There are three types of employees that you can input: Engineer, Intern, and Manager. Each type will be created with a idenitfying icon and with be color coded. A card will be created for each member with basic information such as name, id, email. For engineers you will be asked to list a github account name. For interns you will be asked to list a school. For managers you will be asked to list an office number. 

## Building Experience
All in all this application was fairly straight forward to build. I was given a lot of tools to start with and some bootstrap code/files to work with. From there it was a matter of getting the given tests to pass after building out the specific classes for each type of employee. Once that was completed creating the inquirer app was fairly easy. This was my first time implementing a switch case into my code which made the writing process a whole lot cleaner and easier. I had a lot of fun stylizing this a bit. I thought giving each type of employee their own color made the overall look a bit better so that the employer would have an easier time knowing who is who.
